    r"""Prepare a sparse quantum state on ``qv``.

    A quantum state is sparse if only a small fraction of all coefficients of that state, in the standard qubit basis,
    are non-zero. In this case, the circuit depth needed for the preparation of the state does not depend exponentially
    on the number of qubits any more, as for a generic state preparation algorithm, but only polynomially, while it also
    scales polynomially with the number S of non-zero coefficients.

    There are a number of sparse state preparation algorithms, optimizing different target quantities.
    For now, the function implements only the algorithm due to Gleinig and Hoefler
    (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9586240).
    It produces a circuit with O(S*n) CNOT gates and O(S*log(S)+n) single-qubit gates.
    The classical algorithm needed to find the circuit has a runtime of O(S^2*log(S)*n).

    Parameters
    ----------
    qv : QuantumVariable
        Quantum variable to prepare.
    target_state: scipy.sparse.coo_array or dict
        The sparse quantum state to prepare. It can either be provided as a sparse array of type scipy.sparse.coo_array
        or as a dictionary that contains the coefficient for every binary string.
        The binary strings (i.e. the dictionary keys) can be
        provided as str (e.g. ``'0111'``) or tuples (e.g. ``(0, 1, 1, 1)'``.
    reverse: bool
        Whether the standard little-endian convention should be reversed to a big-endian convention.
        This has only effect if ``target_state`` is provided as a sparse array instead of a dictionary.
        Default is False.
    method: str
        Which method to use. Currently only "gleinig_hoefler" is implemented, which employs the algorithm presented in https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9586240.
